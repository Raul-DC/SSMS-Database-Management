**d. Solve the issue of duplicate records in the final table to prevent it from happening again in the future.**

In SSMS, run the following query:

```sql
WITH CTE_Duplicates AS (
    SELECT 
        CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO, FORMAT, MUESTRA, VALOR, ORIGEN, FECHA_COPIA,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO, FORMAT, MUESTRA, VALOR, ORIGEN, FECHA_COPIA ORDER BY FECHA_COPIA DESC) AS rn
    FROM dbo.Unificado
)
DELETE FROM CTE_Duplicates WHERE rn > 1;
```

**Note:**
Before running this query, I recommend making a backup of the table or running a test query to ensure that only the records you want to delete will be removed. You can do this with:

```sql
WITH CTE_Duplicates AS (
    SELECT 
        CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO, FORMAT, MUESTRA, VALOR, ORIGEN, FECHA_COPIA,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO, FORMAT, MUESTRA, VALOR, ORIGEN, FECHA_COPIA ORDER BY FECHA_COPIA DESC) AS rn
    FROM dbo.Unificado
)
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Duplicates
WHERE rn > 1;
```

This will allow you to see the records that would be deleted.
